# MAIN CONFIGURATION FILE, VERSION 0.6 (split boss events, version bump)
#
# SUPPORTED OPTIONS:
#   - "log" = Log this event to the console and the server logs.
#   - "chat" = Print to chat for people who have the right permissions.
#   - "notice" = Print to Pixelmon's noticeboard (top of screen) if permitted.
#   - "hover" = Adds a hoverable overview if possible. Only works with "chat".
#   - "reveal" = Also reveals IVs in hovers. Needs "hover" and "chat".
#   - To disable all options, remove all listed toggles and then set "none".
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - Hovers are currently unsupported on trades and trainer/PvP battle messages.
#   - Hovers also do not show on noticeboard messages.
#   - Reveals are disabled on all spawns/challenges due to Pixelmon limitations.
#   - Be very careful with enabling reveals on blackouts/forfeits, very abusable!
#   - If a Pokémon is both an UB/legendary and a shiny, either toggle will work.
#
# NOTES:
#   - This sidemod is currently in beta -- functionality WILL change!
#   - To translate or otherwise change event broadcasts, open "broadcasts.conf".
#   - To translate or otherwise change other mod messages, open "messages.conf".
#   - Commands will generally not trigger our events, technical reasons. :(
