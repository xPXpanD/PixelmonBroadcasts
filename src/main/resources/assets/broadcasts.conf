# BROADCAST MESSAGE FILE, VERSION 0.4.2 (no changes since 0.4)
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - Most messages support one or more placeholders from the list below.
#   - Add a 2 to placeholders on supported messages to show the other side.
#   - Messages prefixed with "chat" go to chat, "notice" to the noticeboard.
#
# SUPPORTED PLACEHOLDERS:
#   - %biome%, %world%
#   - %pokemon% + %player% (names)
#   - %ivpercent% (shows a Pokémon's percentage of total IVs, if not an egg)
#   - %xpos% + %ypos% + %zpos% (coordinates -- remember, Y is height in MC!)
#   - %shiny% (inserts "placeholder.shiny" if a Pokémon is shiny, good in trades)
#
# PRO TIP:
#   - https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes is your friend.
