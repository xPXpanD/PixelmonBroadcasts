# BROADCAST MESSAGE FILE, VERSION 0.6.1 (added common and epic boss broadcasts)
#
# IMPORTANT:
#   - Most messages support one or more placeholders from the list below.
#   - Some events can show the other side, too. Example: %player2%
#   - Alolans, Galarians and Mega bosses get their form added before their name.
#   - Messages prefixed with "chat" go to chat, "notice" to the noticeboard.
#
# SUPPORTED PLACEHOLDERS:
#   - %biome%, %world%
#   - %pokemon%, %player%, %nearest% (nearest player to event entity, experimental)
#   - %ivpercent% (shows a Pokémon's percentage of total IVs, if not an egg)
#   - %xpos% + %ypos% + %zpos% (coordinates -- remember, Y is height in MC!)
#   - %shiny% (inserts "placeholder.shiny" if a Pokémon is shiny, good in trades)
#
# PRO TIP:
#   - https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes is your friend.
#
# Please report any issues to the project Github page. Enjoy the mod!    -- XpanD
