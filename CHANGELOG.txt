0.6 for 8.1.2
Released February 8th, 2021.

    Additions:
    * Moved everything to pure Forge! Broadcasts now runs anywhere that supports Forge mods.
    * Added support for single player use! As always, let me know if stuff breaks.
    * When in single player, you get a lighter settings file by default with multiplayer fluff turned off.

    Changes:
    * (temporarily?) Removed integration with the Pixelmon Overlay plugin, as it requires Sponge.
    * Removed the toggle helper when running /pixelmonbroadcasts from console. Can't use it there, anyways.
    * Removed all "pixelmonbroadcasts.action" permissions. Naming was inconsistent, use ".command" instead.

    Message file additions and changes:
    * Combined all non-teleport "no_permissions" messages into "universal.no_permissions".
    * Removed "action." from the teleport nodes as it's now a command. (no Sponge callbacks)
    * Added a few new teleport command errors for the different failure modes.

    Broadcasts file additions and changes:
    * Reworded the non-shiny Ultra Beast and Legendary egg hatch broadcasts to avoid "a"/"an" issues.

0.5 for 8.1.2
Released February 3rd, 2021.

    Additions:
    * Split off boss events into the different tiers. Thanks for the proof-of-concept fork, ElectronicManuel!

    Tweaks:
    * Shortened the info text on console messages from "Pixelmon Broadcasts" to just "Broadcasts".

    Settings file additions and changes:
    * Added settings for the different boss types.
    * Disabled some unpopular/spammy settings by default.

    Message file additions and changes:
    * Added toggles for the different boss types.
    * Added a new placeholder for showing Mega status in broadcasts: insert.mega = "Mega "
    * Added a new placeholder for showing Alolan forms in broadcasts: insert.alolan = "Alolan "
    * Added a new placeholder for showing Galarian forms in broadcasts: insert.galarian = "Galarian "
    * Changed the generic boss toggle's text from "boss" to "any boss". (forfeits use this)

    Broadcasts file additions and changes:
    * Added broadcasts for the different boss types.
    * Flattened down the layout to use single lines, as it was getting unwieldy and caused some confusion.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed colors on event log entries showing up as a series of numbers on some consoles.
    * Ultra Beast and Legendary hatch toggles now work.
    * Toggles are now split onto separate lines if more than 5 are available. Should help with custom text.
    * Toggles are now preserved when a player dies. Some plugins/mods may interfere with this, let me know!

0.4.2 for 8.0.0
Released June 19th, 2020.

    Additions:
    * Added support for showing Galarians in broadcasts.

    Tweaks:
    * Removed the "PBR //" fluff from console messages as the sidemod name is already shown.
    * Removed the config helper that automatically turns off Pixelmon's legendary message. Mod update broke it.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed the horrible spam/crashing from Alolans being moved to a different enum in Pixelmon.
    * Worked around Bide causing a NullPointerException on the Faint event listener. (likely a Pixelmon bug)

0.4.1 for 7.0.5
Released May 15th, 2019.

    Additions:
    * Added support for happyzlife's Pixelmon Overlay, allowing noticeboard sharing with other plugins.

    Tweaks:
    * Removed the Toggle command permission check due to it being unnecessary. We'll use individual perms.

    Message file additions and changes:
    * Removed "hub.no_permissions" and "hub.contact_staff".
    * Added "toggle.no_permissions".
    * Re-worded "action.teleport.no_permissions" to fall in line with other no-perm messages.

    Fixes:
    * Added debug and a workaround for a weird issue that potentially breaks battles. Thanks, I9hdkill!
    * Added some listener safeguards to hopefully avoid issues when other plugins kill the event.
    * Fixed the Toggle command showing only a header and footer to people with no event permissions.

0.4 for 7.0.3
Released March 9th, 2019.

    Additions:
    * Added Pixelmon noticeboard support. Shows stuff in a fancy box at the top, surrounded by sprites!
    * Added an on-click teleport option that allows players to warp to the event's source, if permitted.
    * Added an evolution event. Only fires on successful evolutions, so no spam.
    * Added Ultra Beast broadcasts everywhere.
    * Added Ultra Space wormhole spawn broadcasts.
    * Added legendary/Ultra Beast hatch broadcasts.
    * Added a fainting broadcast for the Nuzlocke crowd.

    Settings file additions and changes:
    * Added new event settings. Config will need a regen, sorry!
    * Renamed the "show" toggle to "chat" to avoid confusion with the new "notice".

    Message file additions and changes:
    * Added new event messages, as well as on-click teleport ones. Config will need a regen, sorry!
    * Removed shiny legendary messages due to them being rolled in with the shiny/legendary checks.

    Broadcasts file additions and changes:
    * Added new event broadcasts. Config will need a regen, sorry!
    * Split "broadcast.EVENT.TYPE" broadcasts into both "chat.EVENT.TYPE" and "notice.EVENT.TYPE".
    * Changed the default hatch and trade colors from pink to gray. Pink is now used for UBs.

    Permission changes:
    * "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade.normal" is now "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade", for consistency.
    * "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.pvp.draw" is now "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.draw.pvp", same idea.

    Tweaks:
    * Simplified shiny legendary settings to work with either event's toggles enabled. UBs work similarly.
    * Simplified logging. Messages are now single colors, depending on the event type.
    * Renamed several internal listeners to make more sense in errors/debug output.

    Fixes:
    * Hopefully fixed several BattleEndListener-related log errors.
    * Fixed a missing space in the default trade broadcast.
    * Fixed IVs, coordinates and world names in the trade broadcast always being from player 1's side.
    * Fixed pyrrhic self-kill wins (think Explosion) not registering as a victory in wild battles.
    * Fixed PvP draws with self-kill moves like Explosion being counted as wins.
    * Fixed shiny legendary forfeit logging not working right. (through rewriting ALL the things)
    * Fixed shown IVs always being rounded down.
    * Fixed trade event permission checks failing in certain setups.
    * Probably fixed player-versus-player battles occasionally getting the winner/loser wrong.
    * Probably fixed us causing Pixelmon battle errors (double kills!) in double battles.

0.3 for 7.0
Released February 2nd, 2019.

    Additions:
    * Added the showing of abilities to the hover stats! (hidden abilities get extra fancy formatting)

    Settings file additions:
    * Added "showAbilities" option for the new ability-showing feature. Add: "showAbilities = true"

    Message file additions:
    * "hover.present_tense.ability"         ->  "➡ &aIt has the \"&2{1}&a\" ability."
    * "hover.present_tense.hidden_ability"  ->  "➡ &aIt has the \"&2&l{1}&r&a\" hidden ability!"
    * "hover.past_tense.ability"            ->  "➡ &aIt had the \"&2{1}&a\" ability."
    * "hover.past_tense.hidden_ability"     ->  "➡ &aIt had the \"&2&l{1}&r&a\" hidden ability..."

    Broadcast file changes:
    * Corrected a small formatting issue on shiny eggs being hatched. (last part of line wasn't bold)
    * Fixed the trade broadcast rarely showing incorrect shiny status for one of the Pokémon.
    * Reworded many broadcasts to preserve consistency even when precursor events aren't announced.

    Tweaks:
    * Brought a few console messages in line with Even More Pixelmon Commands.
    * Hopefully made it so localized setups end up logging both the localized and English Pokémon names.
    * Updated Forge version to build against, from 2705 to 2768. Might fix some issues with flaky toggles.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed /pixelmonbroadcasts not showing commands if something happened to the main command alias.
    * Fixed forfeit messages occasionally reporting bad biomes/coordinates. How'd this even work before?
    * Hopefully fixed legendary-related messages breaking on non-English names. Sorry for the delay!

0.2.2 for 6.3.4
Released August 18th, 2018.

    Message file changes:
    * Changed "toggle.header" to "&5--------- &dPersonal event toggles (click to change) &5--------".
    * Changed "toggle.boss_trainer.on" to "&a&nleader" to prevent cut-off.
    * Changed "toggle.boss_trainer.off" to "&c&nleader" to prevent cut-off.

    Broadcast file changes:
    * Changed all default mentions of "boss trainer" to "leader" to mirror the above.

    Tweaks:
    * Clarified toggles only applying to the person setting them, to avoid further confusion. See changes.
    * Moved the "shiny legend" toggle so it shows after "shiny" and "legend" if enabled. Bit cleaner.
    * Split the mod's start-up messages into two blocks, with one only showing up if something's wrong.

    * Fixed normal catch and blackout messages not being toggle-able.
    * Fixed PvP draws referencing two removed "toggle.pvp_draw" keys, and a missing comma.

Released June 9th, 2018.

    Permission changes:

    * Fixed an issue where old options would occasionally get stuck when reloading with changes made.
    * Fixed some potential bugs with players with edited names. There may be more, please report.
